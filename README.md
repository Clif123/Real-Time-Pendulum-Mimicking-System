# Real-Time-Pendulum-Mimicking-System

## Description
Using the quarter period and lookup table algorithm, a real-time pendulum mimicking system was successfully developed. The quarter period was used to ensure that the motor can move back to its zeroth position without triggering the photoelectric sensor interrupt, therefore reducing delays. The lookup table was used to set the speed and position of the motor more accurately. The system had minimal delays in motion and is very accurate. The PID controller used was also successful in handling any overshoots of the motor from the desired position.
